             --------------------------

                      JUDGMENT



     Petitioners, who are the plaintiffs in O.S.No.

53/07 on the file of the Sub Court, Ernakulam, have

preferred this writ petition seeking for an order

setting aside the order passed by the court below

on I.A.No.9131/08 (Exhibit P6). The order passed on

Exhibit P6 application is not produced.      Without

producing the order that is assailed this writ

petition cannot be entertained.



     In  the  result,   without  prejudice  to   the

petitioners moving afresh, producing also a copy of

the order on Exhibit P6 application, I dismiss this

writ petition.
